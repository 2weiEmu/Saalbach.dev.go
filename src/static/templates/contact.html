			<p>There are multiple ways to reach and directly contact me, though the most interesting to you are probably the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/2weiEmu">My GitHub</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-saalbach-418414203/">My LinkedIn</a></li>
				<li><a href="mailto:robert@saalbach.dev">My Email</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p>If you want to interact with me in other ways, perhaps by simply seeing what I think or other things, there aren't that many spaces where I actively share my opinions and the best you will probably find are my RSS (todo) channel and therefore also my <a href="/blog">Blog</a> page.</p>
			<p>I have some plans to increase my outreach and activity on other platforms and other circles, though that is something that is still coming.</p>
