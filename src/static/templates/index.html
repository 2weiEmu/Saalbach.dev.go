            I'm a student at the <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/">TU Delft</a> in the Netherlands doing a Bachelor in <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/programmes/bachelors/cse/bachelor-of-computer-science-and-engineering/">Computer Science (and Engineering)</a>, looking at Aersopace-related opportunities as well. Being interested in Systems-programming I achieved a perfect grade in the most closely related subject so far, and being registered for the related variant. My interest in Computer Science only grew with me competing in an <a href="https://battlecode.org/past.html">MIT-hosted Hackathon ()</a>, the computer science lessons in High school and me completing a lot of <a>work in my own time</a> as well. If you are link-minded and enthuastic, come talk to me, I am always open to try things.
