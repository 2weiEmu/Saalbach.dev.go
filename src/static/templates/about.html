			<p><span class="his-start">T</span>he majority of my education took place in the Leipzig International School (LIS), which is also in my hometown. in the LIS I completed the IB (International Baccalaureate) programme, a well rounded and extensive high-school program that did a good job preparing me for university. Early on I already took a lot of interest in computers, which my teacher also supported and enabled. My teacher helped me achieved top grades in the class and gain a strong headstart on a lot of CS topics. I also got a perfect grade in my Computer Science Internal Assessment (an essay-like report, and in this case also programming assignment).</p>
			<p>Now I have moved on to the TU Delft in the Netherlands, studying Computer Science and Engineering, a broad programme which enables students to focus on many aspects of Computer Science. This also includes a good range of variants, for which I chose the systems variant.</p>

			<p>As already mentioned on the start page, I am an avid linux user, who has also spent a good bit of time tuning his setup, setting it up to his liking and thinking about his workflow. You can see my exact configuration on my GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/2weiEmu/robert-dotfiles">here</a>) but to also show it here:</p>
