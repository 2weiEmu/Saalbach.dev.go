My First Blog and a Hello
09-08-2023
Just a quick overview of the kind of things you can expect from my blog in terms of what I hope to achieve with it, timing and content.

<p>Hello and welcome to my first blog, and also welcome to my website. I just quickly wanted to make clear what kind of things I will be putting in these blogs and just generally what to expect from them.</p>

<p>These blogs will mainly be a tool to write down bigger thoughts that I have, think about ideas in a text-form, and try to make them concrete. I am publishing them, because I think (and hope) it will motivate me to at least achieve a better form of expression than what I currently have, which essentially consists of jotting down a list of key words associated with a topic hoping that I remember in a month what I meant with all of it. I am also hoping that this improves my writing, at least a bit. I might not be getting immediate feedback, which is important when wanting to master something, but that is something that I did want to think about adding, perhaps in the form of a comment section. (Assuming that eventually enough people will read my blog)</p>

<p>As a result of me writing about things when I feel like and about topics that interest me when they come up, as well as depending on when I have time to write something longer and well thought-out about a topic, these blogs will not be very well, well-timed or really scheduled at all.</p>

<p>The main topics that you can expect from this blog, will probably mainly be software, hardware, technology in general, and I will voice my opinions on things, don't you worry. (though I will admit, I am still relatively new to software I guess, especially compared to the veterans, so take that for what it is) I am not sure that I want to touch on politics on my website, but that is something that could change depending on how things develop. Of course I would want to say my piece about less political or at least less controversial topics perhaps, but I will always consider, at least a bit, to tread into deeper waters and put myself out there, also in the hopes of refining my opinion (again, I should have a comment section for that, and that is something that I will add... eventually)</p>

<p>All right, well I hope you got an idea of what you are in for using this first blog. Happy reading!</p>
