# How to Structure a Blog Accordingly, for this Website

(Everything here should be done exactly line by line)
The name of the blog should be the BlogPathName.

(line 1 to be clear): [BlogTitle]
[BlogDate] DD-MM-YYYY
[BlogShortPreview / Description]
[BlogPathName]
[BlogWritten in HTML (maybe be multi-line)

                >]


## new Blog structure (version 2) (TODO)

line 1 to be clear: [BlogVersionNumber -> full int]
[BlogTitle]
[BlogDate] DD-MM-YYYY
[BlogAuthor]
[BlogShortPreview / Description]
[BlogPathName]
[BlogTopics]
[BlogNotes] 
[

 HTML
 ...
]

TODO: I should honestly make this blog thing its own module in some way, so its separated from this code and can simply be called in some way.
