# My Personal Website

Just my small personal website, with everything you would need to know about me, written in Go.

# To-Do

~~- [ ] Add a Mascot~~
- [x] Create About Page
- [x] Make Blog Page
- [x] Add Text / Re-write
- [x] New, cooler modern, yet fast design
- [x] Logo
- [ ] Add Mux from Go for better code
- [ ] Make it so that the reusable parts of a website are reused, using some standard writers and things like that (just for compactness and cleanliness on our side, and also easier modification if required - of course some logic might be needed (a little for some of the highlighting we do in the reusable parts but it should be fine)
- [ ] Make a comment section
